# Implementing-a-Q-learning-algorithm
Implementing RL algorithm on mountaincar environment

This project was done for academic purposes, in colaboration with my dear research fellow Vincent CANIPEL. For me the goal was to learn how to implement an RL algorithm.
The code mainly follows the instructions given in this tutorial: https://pythonprogramming.net/q-learning-reinforcement-learning-python-tutorial/
